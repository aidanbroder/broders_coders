            <ul class = "languageUl">
            
            <li class = "lvlDesc"> Level 1: Absolute Beginner - No previous coding
              experience is needed or reccomended to start learning level 1 languages. This language
              is the perfect starting place for beginners, but people with a little coding experience will still
              benefit and learn a lot from this language!
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class = "lvlDesc"> Level 2: Experience with a level 1 language like Scratch
              is reccomended before starting a level 2 language, since they will learn programming concepts
              very quickly. However, absolute beginners can definitely jump straight into a level 2 language,
              but it just might take a little longer to learn certain concepts.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class = "lvlDesc"> Level 3: These languages have more difficult syntax (the punctation and grammer of coding)
              than the other languages, so I would reccomend learning a language like Scratch or Python prior
            to learning one of these langauges. You can definitely jump into HTMl and CSS without any coding
          experience, and learn how to build a basic webpage, but it might take you longer to learn the more
        advanced topics. Java is super similar to python, but just has more compelx syntax.</li>
